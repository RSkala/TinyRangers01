Game / Scene Information:


Character / Player Sprites:
* Character sprites are built at 32x32, but are functionally smaller.

Sprites:
* I have set the sprite Pixels Per Unit to 16 for the entire game (set in TextureImporter Presets).


Camera:
* Pixel Perfect Camera Component
  * Assets Pixels Per Unit:  16
  * Reference Resolution:  480 x 270


Reference Resolution Info:
* 640x360 = 1920x1080 / 3
* 480x270 = 1920x1080 / 4 => Common pixel art game reference resolution
* 384x216 = 1920x1080 / 5
* 320x180 = 1920x1080 / 6 => Common pixel art game reference resolution

I chose 480x270 because the view will be larger compared to 320x180.
The player character will be smaller on the screen, but players will be able to see more of everything else on the screen.
I may choose another (possibly uncommon) reference resolution if the player seems to small.
